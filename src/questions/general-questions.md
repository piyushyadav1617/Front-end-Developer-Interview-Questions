- Can you describe the difference between progressive enhancement and graceful degradation?
- How would you optimize a website's assets/resources?

- What is Flash of Unstyled Content? How do you avoid FOUC?

  - ANS: FOUC stands for Flash of Unstyled Content and occurs when a web page is briefly displayed without its intended CSS styles. It can be a jarring experience for users and can make a website feel unprofessional or incomplete.

  To avoid FOUC, there are several strategies that web developers can employ. One approach is to use inline styles in the HTML to ensure that the page is styled before any external CSS files are loaded. Another strategy is to use server-side rendering, which generates the final HTML with styles before sending it to the client. Finally, developers can also use JavaScript to dynamically load CSS files after the page has loaded, but this can add additional complexity to the code.

  Overall, the key to avoiding FOUC is to make sure that the page is styled as quickly as possible, whether that is through inline styles, server-side rendering, or dynamic loading of CSS files.

- Explain what ARIA and screenreaders are, and how to make a website accessible.
  - ANS: ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. It is a set of guidelines and technical specifications developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to make web content and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities, such as visual impairments or motor impairments. ARIA provides a way to add metadata and attributes to web content, which can be interpreted by assistive technologies such as screen readers to help users with disabilities interact with web applications.
    Screen readers are assistive technologies that help people with visual impairments to access and navigate digital content, such as web pages, documents, and applications. A screen reader is a software program that reads the content of a computer screen aloud using synthesized speech or a refreshable Braille display.
- Explain some of the pros and cons for CSS animations versus JavaScript animations.
  - ANS: CSS animations are easy to implement and fast, but limited in complexity and flexibility. JavaScript animations offer more control and flexibility, but can be more difficult to implement and slower than CSS animations. The choice depends on the project's needs and requirements.
- What does CORS stand for and what issue does it address?
  - ANS: CORS stand for cross-origin resource sharing. It s a security feature implemented in web browsers that prevents a webpage from accessing resources (such as data or files) from another domain, unless that domain specifically allows it.
- How would you handle a disagreement with your boss or your collaborator?
  - ANS: I would try to communicate properly with all the facts I can gather about the issue and also try to understand the other side. I would also consider asking a third party about the disagreement.
- What resources do you use to learn about the latest in front end development and design?
  - ANS: I usually use different resources like documentations, videos,reddit, some already made prpjects by others. But it really depends upon the technology.
- What skills are needed to be a good front-end developer?
  - ANS: I think a good front-end developer should be able to develop applications in any modern libraries like React, and should be able to handle APIs properly, a basic backend knowlendge is good, and writing styles in a clean way.
- What role do you see yourself in?
  - ANS: I see myslef as a frontend developer and in future as a full stack developer and maybe able to develop more efficient applications.
- Explain the difference between cookies, session storage, and local storage?
  - ANS: Cookies, session storage, and local storage are all ways to store data on the client-side, but they differ in their size limits, lifespan, and accessibility. Cookies are small text files that are sent to the server with every request, while session storage and local storage are not. Session storage is deleted when the user closes the browser, while local storage can persist even after the browser is closed.
